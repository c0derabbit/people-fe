**Peoplegraph** is a very simple directory where one can create and look up contacts, take notes about their work, hobbies, last contact date, and establish connections between them (e.g. Laura is Maria’s sister.)

It’s a frontend for [Sam’s people-api](https://github.com/samuelbalogh/people-api), and the project came out of a self-organised hackathon.

#### Tech stack

PG is written in TypeScript and Next.js.

#### Next steps

- verify Google Auth token properly
- improve test coverage
- make connection select searchable, so it can handle a long list of people
- fix some sloppy typings

#### Note

The BE runs on Heroku, so the dyno might take some time (or a refresh) to wake up.
